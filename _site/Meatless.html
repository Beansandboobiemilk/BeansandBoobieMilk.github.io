Humans are at the top, and it makes sense that we consume those below us, just like many mammals on the planet. However, we know that meat is not necessary for survival, particularly in the amounts that the USA eats. In 2007 the average American ate 270 pounds of meat each year. Doesn’t sound like too much to you? Let’s do the math. To eat 270 pounds in 365 days a person has to eat around 12oz of meat EVERY DAY. That’s four, 3oz portions-we only eat 3 meals a day! As a comparison, Indians, which have the lowest meat consumption, averaged 7 pounds of meat in a year. 2.5% of what Americans ate. I like bacon as much as the next girl, but come on. There is NO way that my cravings for bacon can be justified when weighed with the damage it does to my health, my wallet, and my earth. And yours don’t either. The classic “meat and potatoes” meal has taken over our concept of a balanced meal, but it’s time to make a change. If you aren't making efforts to go meatless occasionally, it's time to start. You will save money, and you will be taking necessary steps towards protecting your own health, along with the health of the entire planet.</p> <p>If everyone in the US went meatless for 1 day we would save 100 billion gallons of water, and 70 million gallons of gas. That’s about 18% of all the gas consumed by Americans each day. How could something as simple as choosing a salad over a burger impact the planet so much? Here’s how:</p> <p>Raising livestock blows through resources including water, electricity, and land at a tremendous rate. Even though we squeeze those guys in as small a space as possible, animals need room, food, and water to grow. And when you're raising enough animals to feed the more than 300 million people in this country, the resource needs are extremely high. Cows, specifically, consume 16 times more grain than meat they produce. What a bizarre system. We produce pounds of edible and nutritious food in order to get 1/16th of the food back. It takes 5,000 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef compared to 49 gallons for 1 pound of apples-yet 783 million people worldwide don’t even have access to clean water for themselves. 80% of Brazil's deforestation is for soy (which feeds cattle) and cattle themselves. Humans are literally tearing down the Amazon rainforest, home to 10% of the world’s animal species and 20% of the world’s bird species, so that we can feed and house more cows. I care WAY more about the survival rates of those species than I do about you or I having a meatball with our spaghetti. </p> <p>Eating meat is a top contributor to global warming as well. Livestock produce more greenhouse gases than all forms of transportation combined. And yes, it's basically from toots. Not to be harder on cattle than any other animals, but they really are the biggest culprits. If you've ever driven past a cattle farm you are familiar with the stench of cow toots. And those toots are filled with methane gas, which is 23 times more powerful than CO2. Not to mention the decline of air quality as trees are cut down (remember those deforestation numbers from before) to make more land for those cows to toot on. If you don’t believe that global warming is a real threat to society by now, well, you deserve to be thrown in to the Artic to feed the starving polar bears. </p> <p>I get it though, environmental impacts are hard to use as motivation to make life changes. I’m a hippie and a tree hugger and blah blah blah. Most struggle to recognize the impact they would make on their own amongst the millions of other people not making changes. Your own health is on the line too, and that's something I hope most of you see the value in. If you’ve ever said, “CANCER AND HEART DISEASE?! Those sound scary and awful, I would love to do everything in my power to avoid those terrible health complications,” you’re in luck! Studies all over the world have shown a direct link between meat consumption and increased cancer and cardiovascular death. In a change that made headlines just a few months ago, the WHO officially listed processed meats in the same category as cigarettes for being known carcinogens, and red meat as a likely carcinogen. One study by Harvard found that each routine, daily serving of red meat increased a person’s risk of death by 13%. Don't forget too, when you eat less meat you eat more plants. Plants in the diet are proven to lower cancer risk, as well as improve cholesterol levels and blood pressure. </p> <p>Lastly, because this is opinion and not based on fact, animals don't deserve to be treated how they are by the meat industry. Tight spaces, brutal and sometimes painful deaths, unnatural diets, no access to fresh air, etc. It's just not humane. And though I admit, I care more about beautiful Amazonian big cats than I do pigs, I still don’t want any of them to suffer. </p> <p>Sold on cutting down your meat intake, but not sure how to start? Here are some easy steps towards a reduced meat lifestyle:</p> <blockquote><p>1. Mix your ground meat with beans. Black, pinto, or white can easily be mashed in to ground turkey or hamburger with minimal taste or texture changes. Imagine if every pound of meat magically lasted for twice as many meals. Plus you get the bonus of increased fiber intake from those nutritional power houses-the bean.</p> <p>2. Cut out only beef entirely. I'm sure you figured out from the statistics that beef is the worst meat all around. From your health to the environment, giving up beef will make a huge impact that is sure to last. Any recipe calling for ground beef can be replaced with ground turkey or chicken with only subtle changes in flavor. Add a bit of olive oil to the meat before cooking, it will keep it juicy while giving you that heart healthy dose of Omega 3s.</p> <p>3. Eat wild game. I can't get on board with this because of Bambi and social norms, however! Getting meat from animals that are living in the wild eliminates nearly all of the environmental damage. Deer, specifically, are overpopulated and honestly need to be eaten more so they will leave my plants alone...</p> <p>4. Change the meat and produce ratio. Whenever I cook an omnivorous recipe I halve the meat and double the vegetable. Making chicken noodle soup? 1/2 pound of chicken to 2 cups of carrots, 1 cup of celery and onion. A lunchtime BLT? Use only 2 slices of bacon, add an extra slice of tomato, and a hearty smear of avocado.</p></blockquote> <p>Good luck. And seriously, please, <strong>eat more rabbit food.</strong></p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2016 All rights reserved.

Breastfeeding and making your own baby food means you don’t need anything down that lane. However, I’m a pediatric dietitian, and my career is teaching parents how to feed their children well. Parents often ask what is best for their little ones to eat because it's so hard to wade through the hundreds of options on the shelves. I try to make an effort to go down that row at the grocery store at least once a month, so I know what decisions these parent have to make each day. I’ve started to really hold a grudge against that aisle. With extreme cost mark ups, and strategic wording, baby food companies are truly taking advantage of the only thing that unites all parents-the desire to raise a healthy baby. So, here are the items I educate on the most, so parents can make informed decisions on their feeding choices. <p>Baby juice is not real. Well, it is real, but there isn't an actual need for it in the market place. It's just regular juice with a baby brand on the label. Most importantly, JUICE IS NOT GOOD FOR BABIES. Infants need to develop a taste for water, and I promise that won't go well if the alternative is sweet, colorful, and flavorful. You know when you think you're going to drink Sprite, but it's actually water? The water tastes like poison at first. Once you know it is water you can drink it happily. The same thing happens to infants that get juice while they are learning about water. If they try water and don't like it parents are quick to offer juice. From that moment on, water will always taste worse than something else. If they simply continue to drink water, they will eventually love it. Not only that, but juice often leads to tooth decay, diarrhea, and rashes. Water is the only beverage other than breastmilk or formula any child under the age of one should receive. Small amounts of juice can be used to naturally alleviate constipation, or as a very occasional (1 time a week or less) treat once the child is 1. It should never be offered every day. Ever. <p>I also don't believe in infant puffs. Yes they are a great size for little fingers, yes their dissolving nature makes them less of a choking hazard, but those are pretty much their only benefit. Otherwise they are filled with chemicals, sugar, and not much else. These seem to be a go-to snack for parents, but how do you expect your child to feel full when they aren't eating any fat, protein, or fiber? In reality, puffs tend to be used as a temporary babysitter. “Oh my kid is fussing? Just throw him some of these sweet cardboard chunks and he will settle right down.” In my opinion, they teach children to eat when they are bored, eat sweets all day, and snack mindlessly. <p>My favorite baby snack is beans. Beans are cheap, fast, and easy to pack. I simply open a can of bean (any variety) give them a good rinse to reduce the sodium levels, and store them in the fridge. I fill a small Tupperware before we leave the house and keep it in my diaper bag. Though they aren't as shelf stable as a puff, I feel safe giving them to her 3-4 hours after they have left the fridge. I also give her beans when she is waiting for dinner in her high chair at home and at restaurants. I break them in half so they are a safe size to eat, but still big enough for her fingers to grip. She delightfully feeds herself, or the dog, while waiting patiently for the rest of dinner. This routine leaves us both happy and able to enjoy mealtimes together. I know beans are a weird food. They are mushy on the inside, have a pungent flavor, and they kind of look like tiny bugs. BUT, they are also incredibly good for you. The offer fiber and protein to help a baby feel full. They are also a source of iron, folate, and magnesium. Giving my baby beans on a regular basis means that not only is she benefitting from actual nutrition when she snacks, but also she will grow up comfortable and, hopefully, loving them through her childhood! <p>My strongest hatred for baby products is formula designed "for supplementing." Several brands make it, and it's marketed for women that are breastfeeding, but are starting to use formula occasionally. Recipe wise, this means the company has added pre or probiotics in an effort to mimic breastmilk's immune support (*hint, they are failing). Marketing wise this is another attempt to set breastfeeding women up for failure. When you have a newborn and you're tired, nervous, and unsure, seeing a product that enforces supplementing is one more drop of doubt in your already overflowing I Cant Do This bucket. It makes a woman let her guard down about formula, because "this one is different and more like breastmilk than those others formulas." There aren't any warnings on the can that remind the mom that supplementing with formula typically leads to quitting breastfeeding forever. Seeing that product on the shelves has a similar effect to being handed a sample from your doctor at a newborn check up: mothers think they are supposed to be using it, and that their milk isn't good enough after all. It's one thing to make a conscious decision to start supplementing, but it's completely different to decide to start supplementing because the product exists. Formula is formula, and you are less likely to succeed at breastfeeding once you start using it. <p>On a happier note, I do have to give a shout out to baby food pouches. I’ve only used these while traveling, but they were a lifesaver. I do think that these pouches are changing the ways kids are eating produce in an amazing way. Parents are turning to these as snacks instead of chips and fruit snacks. Kids are eating kale with a smile on their face. Fruit and vegetable pouches are helping make produce an on-the-go food, which was once the biggest argument against them. I see kids from 1 to 12 sucking these guys down, and I am 100% behind them. Please always check your labels to make sure there are no added sugars. If the flavor is white bean, squash, and kale. The ingredient list should be pretty straight forward-white bean, squash, kale. I would also encourage parents to use the reusable, make your own variety. The premade pouches create a great deal of waste, but I’ll leave that alone for now. My focus is getting your kids to eat their veggies, and if eating them from a foil bag is the best way for now, so be it! Suck away-no word play intended. <p>When it comes to feeding your baby, remember that they are tiny humans. They don’t need special dissolvable snacks, or fancy drinks because they are bored with water. They need well-balanced meals made of real food. If it comes in a package, it probably comes with chemicals, additives, or dyes that are best to avoid. Feed them breastmilk, only feed them formula if you have to. Once they are old enough, give them water, if they won’t drink it they aren’t thirsty. Feed them vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. Sound familiar? It should, because it’s what every human needs, babies included. Labels, brand names, and kiddie-words exist not to make your child healthier, but to take your money faster. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2016 All rights reserved.

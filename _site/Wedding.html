I mentally wrote this 3 years ago as a Facebook rant, but I hate Facebook rants, and it was too close to our actual wedding and I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. But enough time has passed, I think it’s time I speak my piece. <p>Rob and I got married when I was only 23. I was the first to get married of nearly everyone I knew, so it really felt like unchartered territory. Planning the wedding became my full-time job while I was between my dietetic internship and finding an actual big girl occupation. Each detail took days to decide and prep, and if I say so myself, we had one heck of a celebration. <p>The one thing that truly bothered me about the entire experience was the lack of etiquette and manners that were followed by a majority of my friends. Like I said, it's been 3.5 years since then, and I'm sure everyone has learned how to be a good wedding guest by now, so I don't mind saying, most of them were a huge hassle. So, just in case you still aren't sure of what is ok or not, here is a list of things that you should do in order to be a good little wedding guest. <blockquote><p>1. RSVP. Actually do it. I know you get that cute invite and you get all excited for the big day, but that second card and/or website that is listed is there for a reason. Brides and grooms need counts and names to plan seating charts, meals, and expenses. They shouldn't have to track you down to see if you're coming. Let them know as soon as you do. If you miss the RSVP deadline, it’s too late. Much goes on behind the scenes of a wedding and changing the number of guests usually isn’t allowed or possible. <p>2. When you submit your RSVP list EVERY person coming. If that number is larger than what was listed on your invitation, then you're doing it wrong. If your invite does give you a guest, make sure to tell the bride or groom who you are bringing And one last thing, for the love of Pete, don't just show up with an extra person that no one had any idea was coming. <p>3. Don’t ask to bring a date. Plus-ones are a luxury at a wedding. Each person typically costs the couple $100, and when you are feeding 100 people that adds up fast. The bride (or groom) doesn't want to deal with feelings of guilt for telling you no, nor does she/he want an extra stranger at the biggest day of his/her life. A girl that asked to bring a date to my wedding recently got engaged and made an entire Facebook post begging people to stop asking for plus ones. The irony was overwhelmingly funny to me. <p>4. Bring a gift that you planned ahead. It's ok if that gift is simply a handwritten letter in an envelope. Although most couples expect you to spend money on them, that isn't the point of the celebration and it's ok if you can't afford it. But that doesn't mean you bring nothing. Some kind words of adoration or appreciation are still a nice gesture. Please also don't just hand one of them cash at the reception. Cash is great, but it's hard to keep track of during the busiest night of your life. When Rob and I got to our hotel he pulled out a huge wad of $20 bills but almost no memory of who handed him how much, etc. Put it in a card or mail it late. Don't give the couple homework. <p>5. Express your gratitude. One way our guests didn't let us down was telling us how great a time they had at our wedding. As a bride, you spend a ton of time thinking about what other people will think about all your hard work. It’s very rewarding to be told that your efforts were noticed and appreciated. Rob and I still have people tell us our wedding was one of the best they've ever attended. I have no clue if they are lying, but it puts a smile on my face regardless. If a wedding was truly a bummer, at least mention something about the decor, invitation, or details you know they spent time working on. <p>I don't have any type of credentials for proper etiquette. I'm not sure if those exist or not? But I was raised by a woman that believed strongly in thank you cards, manners, and fulfilling obligations. Being a good guest will not only make the couple happy, but when it comes time for your big day, you won't have to live with feelings of regret for how crappy you were to some other bride 2 years ago. </p></p></p></p></p></p></blockquote></p></p></p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2016 All rights reserved.

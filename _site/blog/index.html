Unfortunately, because this leaves some people feeling judged or attacked, breastfeeding is also under some scrutiny. As a breastfeeding advocate, I simply want everyone to feel educated, encouraged, and supported.

Antiquated practices recommended starting as early as 4 months, and I still get clients that are told to put cereal in their 2 month olds bottles!

I consider myself to be a breastfeeding advocate, but I’ve come to realize that means different things to different people.

Breastfeeding and making your own baby food means you don’t need anything down that lane. However, I’m a pediatric dietitian, and my career is teaching parents how to feed their children well.

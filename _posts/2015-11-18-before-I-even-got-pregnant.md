<p>Before I even got pregnant, I knew I would plan to have my babies without pain medications. I like knowing my strengths as a woman, and I saw no better way to test my mental and physical limit than to deliver a baby naturally. Now that I’m on the other side of that goal, I can’t say enough positive things about the experience. I encourage every woman that asks to deliver without pain medications, and I’m quite vocal about my positive experience. <p>Pain medications have a pretty serious benefit…they make it so you don’t feel the almost indescribable pain of pushing a baby out of your vagina. That right there is a pretty big win, and I know that’s enough of a reason to make up your mind as soon as you find out you’re pregnant. Delivery is the toughest part of early parenthood and anything you can do to make it easier seems great. However, it doesn’t come without it’s drawbacks. <p>A huge motivator for me was cost. If I had chosen to have an epidural I would have had an additional $1200 bill. At the time I planned to go back to work, and $1200 was enough money saved to let me take my full 12-week FMLA leave. That decision mattered even more when we decided I would only go back to work part-time. I’m also exposed to horror stories occasionally, because I work with postpartum women every day. Though rare, epidurals can cause permanent damage, heart attacks, and blood pressure drops that lead to high-risk delivery

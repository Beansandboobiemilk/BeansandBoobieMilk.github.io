I’m Hannah. I’m a registered dietitian (RD), a certified lactation specialist (CLS), and an aspiring International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBLCL). 

I’m married to a wonderful man I met when I was only 19, and together we have a 1 year old daughter! My husband is a researcher at a state university, and my daughter is everything a one year old should be. I work part-time as a dietitian, and with all the rest of my time I’m a stay at home. That combination means that 90% of my days revolve around eating. Whether I’m educating a client at the office, nursing my baby, or prepping balanced meals for my whole family, food is who I am.  

I’m a breastfeeding advocate, meatless meal enthusiast (though we aren’t vegetarians), and new recipe crazed. I create my own meals occasionally, but much of my cooking time is spent trying out all the ideas already on the web. This blog will be a combination of my thoughts and experiences with pregnancy, breastfeeding, nutrition, cooking, and living life as a mid-twenties woman/mom/wife/dietitian.
